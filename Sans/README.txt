Additional Test ideas:
Try different combinations of Release Date, Rating and Title. For example,
I could input Release Date and Rating then check if the 'Add Movie' button is enabled.  Another example would be
set Rating and Title or Release Date and Title.  

Have tests that try to input more than 4 characters into the year in Release Date.

Tests that would use the date picker instead of sending keys to the Release Date field.

Verify negative numbers and numbers over 5 don't work for the Rating field.

Verify characters don't work in Rating field or Release Date field.

See what happens when trying to click a disabled button (this would have to be done with the JavaScriptExecutor).
